# Arduino-Based Drone
### To Do (No Order):
- Complete the rest of Make: Drones Teaching an Arduino to Fly
    - Create list of parts
- Finish setting up TensorFlow and OpenCV on Pi
- Learn how to implement a Kalman Filter, Bayesian Filter, histogram filter, and particle filter
- Learn A * for Path Finding
- Potential Google Maps API integration (Time Dependent)

### Week One: 2/17 - 2/23
1. ~~Install TF & OpenCV~~
2. Complete Make: Drones
3. Calculate energy usage for project
4. Order parts
    - Calculate approximate kV and mAh for batteries
    - Still Need: Props, brushless motors, ESC, airframe, PDB, ArduPilot, telemetry radio, IMU, GPS, Bluetooth (optional), LiPo batteries
    - Have: Teensy 2.0, Arduino's, Raspberry Pi, wires, ultrasonic sensors, 3D printer for custom parts (time dependent)
5. Get comfortable using APM Planner
