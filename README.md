# Arduino-Based Drone
### To Do (No Order):


- ~~Complete the rest of Make: Drones Teaching an Arduino to Flyi~~
    - ~~Create list of parts~~

###### Software
- ~~Finish setting up TensorFlow and OpenCV on Pi~~
- Learn how to implement a Kalman Filter, Bayesian Filter, histogram filter, and particle filter
- Learn A * for Path Finding
- Potential Google Maps API integration (Time Dependent)

### Current Problems:
- ~~Pi ran out of storage~~
- ~~Calculating energy needed to power device while remaining light~~
	- Should be good with 5000mAh+


### Week One: 2/17 - 2/23
1. ~~Install TF & OpenCV~~
2. ~~Complete Make: Drones~~
3. ~~Calculate energy usage for project~~
	- ~~Learn how to read & create schematics~~
4. ~~Order parts [Work in Progress 2/26]~~
    - Calculate approximate kV and mAh for batteries
    - Still Need: Props, brushless motors, ESC, airframe, PDB, ArduPilot, telemetry radio, IMU, GPS, Bluetooth (optional), LiPo batteries
    - Have: Teensy 2.0, Arduino's, Raspberry Pi, wires, ultrasonic sensors, 3D printer for custom parts (time dependent)
5. ~~Get comfortable using APM Planner~~

### Week Two: 2/24 - 3/1
####### Main Focus: Hardware Basics
1. Make a dumb drone with parts
2. Spend time on Fritzig
	- Learn how to read and create schematics
    - Create diagram
3. Determine whether Movidius is worth it or not
4. Implement A *
5. Get started looking at Google Maps API with Pi
